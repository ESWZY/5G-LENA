/**
 * \ingroup helper
 * \brief The RealisticBeamformingHelper class that helps user create beamforming tasks
 * and configure when these tasks should be executed. This helper also collects SRS measurements
 * for each gNB and UE. This helper class is currently compatible only with the
 * RealisticBeamformingAlgorithm.
 *
 * Similarly to IdealBeamformingHelper, since there is no real beamforming procedure,
 * there must be a class that will be able to emulate the beamforming procedure, and that is,
 * to update the beamforming vectors of both devices, gNB and UE, at the same time.
 *
 * In ideal algorithms there is a run function that is used to run all beamforming tasks (updates)
 * at the same time. Here is different, not all beams are updated at the same time,
 * instead each beamforming task will be triggered based on its own event (SRS count or delay)
 * To allow that, this class has attribute through which can be set the trigger event type.
 * E.g., the trigger event can be that it has been received a certain number of SRSs signals
 * from a UE.
 * This helper saves all SRS reports for each gNB and all of its users, and it is saved per
 * component carrier identified by cellId.
