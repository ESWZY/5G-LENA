 * \ingroup gnb-phy
 * \brief Generate "Real" beamforming vectors
 * This class is inherited by all algorithms that do not assume the
 * perfect knowledge of the channel, but instead are performing the
 * estimation of the channel based on measurements, e.g., based on
 * SRS SINR measurement.
 *
 * RealisticBeamformingAlgorithm purpose is to generate beams for the pair
 * of communicating devices based on the SRS measurements. Differently from
 * IdealBeamformingAlgorithm this type of algorithm does not assume a perfect
 * knowledge of the channel. It instead estimates the long-term fast fading
 * channel component based on the received SRS. Accordingly, this approach
 * could be used with any beamforming algorithm that makes use of the channel
 * estimation, e.g., beam search method (e.g., such as the one implemented in
 * CellScanBeamforming class). Note that the LOS type of method (e.g., such as
 * the one implemented in DirectPathBeamforming class) does not use the
 * channel matrix, but instead the angles of arrival and departure of the LOS
 * path, and so, the proposed method is not valid for it. Currently, it is
 * only compatible with the beam search method."
